# How to setup GDB for remote debugging of Embedded Devices

Due to unexpected errors during GDB setup in a seperate tutorial, it was decided to dive into a in-depth investigation on how to setup GDB for remote debugging and the debugging of the setup itself. This will include configuation needed aswell as issues that arised. This will be based on *Buildroot* configuration settings and serve purely as note keeping for Morne Le Roux
